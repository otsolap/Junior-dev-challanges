## Coffee App | Full-Stack

Write a www-site that lets you save your favourite coffees. This includes name, the package weight, the price and roast level (select option ranging from 1-5).

List these coffees in either the same or different page as the form. Create a backend (Node, Java, Kotlin or Golang) that saves the data to a local text file (or json). Collect the data in the backend as well. Also create unit tests.
